			<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> 2 prototypes, each with:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Photos of key prototype "screens" showing your novel features and a simple HTML page that explains them and justifies the improvements (1-2 sentences max per improvement).</li>
			<li>A video of you interacting with your "screens" (as in the Nielsen Norman group video) to carry out the tasks you expect users to perform with your interface.
			The prototype should be clearly visible in the video, as well as your hands interacting with it.</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- - A short video of a user performing tasks with your paper prototype, description of your three tasks, and insights from the user testing.
			- Link to your HTML & CSS mockup. Include a short description of your improvements. -->
